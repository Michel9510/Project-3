# Project-3
This project uses an API to display facts about anime.

Upon loading the page the tab titles are fetched from the animeFacts API. Whatever tab is clicked on a fetch request is made to retrive the anime facts. The selected tab will be displayed until another tab is clicked.

# Technology Used
Javascript, HTML and CSS

With Javascript i used the fetch method to access the anime facts. I created a function to add the facts and an image on every tab clicked. I added an event listener so the selected tab will display until another tab is clicked.

With CSS i styled the page
